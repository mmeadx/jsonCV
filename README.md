# JSON CV

_An application that uses resume information stored on MongoDB using Node.js, EJS and a variety of npm modules to populate multiple templates from a single JSON file - all hosted on a Heroku server._


_Applying to jobs can be a long and tedious process due to an infinite number of ways to submit applications. My goal with this program is to standardize the way resumes are built and submitted so that the process is easier for both the applicant and the potential employer_

_This application will eventually have a user login that will take them to an area where they can put in their own information - populating every resume template available_

**_Personal Template_**
_With a photo and links to social accounts - this template is meant to have a bit more personality. Clean lines and boxes around content allow for a readable template_
