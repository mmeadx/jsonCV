# JSON CV

_An application that uses resume information stored on MongoDB using Node.js, EJS and a variety of npm modules to populate multiple templates from a single JSON file - all hosted on a Heroku server._

_Applying to jobs can be a long and tedious process due to an infinite number of ways to submit applications. My goal with this program is to standardize the way resumes are built and submitted so that the process is easier for both the applicant and the potential employer_
